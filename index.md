## 🔭 Research Interests
I am broadly interested in the intersection of:

- **Learning-Based Control and Safe Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC)** for autonomous vehicles and spacecraft  
- **Uncertainty-aware decision-making and robustness**  
- **Autonomous systems for orbital operations and space robotics**  

My goal is to develop control architectures that combine formal guarantees with learning-enabled adaptivity for complex, safety-critical systems.

## 🚀 Current Research Direction (High-Level)
I am investigating a research direction focused on **learning-augmented GNC for autonomous spacecraft** with applications to **end-of-life satellite operations** and **space sustainability**.

The work explores hybrid control architectures, uncertainty-aware algorithms, and high-level decision strategies for operating in highly uncertain orbital environments.

*A detailed concept note (1–2 pages) is available upon request.*

## 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a Research Fellow at **Politecnico di Milano** (MOVE Research Group), where I work on the development of advanced GNC architectures for both **space systems** and **autonomous driving**.

I obtained my **MSc in Automation and Control Engineering**, graduating with **110/110 cum laude**.  
My research contributions include:

- robust state estimation for reusable launch vehicles  
- motion sickness–aware planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles  
- development of GNC modules within industrial and academic frameworks
